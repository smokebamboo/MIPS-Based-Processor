## About This Repository

This repository is a mirror of the original project [MIPS-Based-Processor](https://github.com/taconoodle/MIPS-Based-Processor), which I collaborated on as a developer.  
During development, my contributions were made locally, so my individual commits are not reflected in the GitHub history.

### My Contributions
- Contributed to the system architecture and core logic design
- Participated in debugging and testing
- Contributed to design and code structure discussions

This fork is intended to showcase my work and involvement in the project while giving full credit to the original repository and team.
